<p>If you've just had a stressful experience then this interactive page will help you calm down and get over it. It will guide you through a process of analysing away your stress.</p>
<p>Your use of this program is completely anonymous, but for research purposes, your ratings of your own stress levels are sent back for analysis. The data so far show that many people are helped by the program.</p>
<p>Now decide if you want help with a stressful event that just happened or you are just having a look.</p>
